🧠 Brain Tumor Detection using Deep Learning
📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on automated brain tumor detection using Deep Learning techniques. The model processes MRI scans and classifies whether a brain tumor is present. It leverages Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to achieve accurate classification.

🚀 Features
✅ Automated detection of brain tumors from MRI images
✅ High accuracy using CNN-based deep learning models
✅ Preprocessing techniques for image enhancement
✅ User-friendly interface for image upload and classification

🛠️ Tech Stack
Python (Primary Language)
TensorFlow/Keras (Deep Learning Framework)
OpenCV (Image Processing)
Flask/Django (Web Interface - if applicable)
NumPy & Pandas (Data Handling)
